The first command I used was
git grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information" -- '*'
This command searched all the files in the repo for the above string. The output of that showed me that string was in file northamerica
and written on line 900. 
After that I ran the command:
git blame -L 895,905 northamerica
With the output of this, I found which commit affected line 900. The shorthand was c8f960ec7. To investigate it further I ran the command:
git show c8f960ec7
This finally outputted the culprit of the commit and the date of it
commit c8f960ec72312d0d4368fc025a57812d8f8021f2
