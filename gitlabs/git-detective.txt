The first command I used was to output all instances of git merge-tree in read-only repositories. Command:
git log --grep="git merge-tree" --grep="read-only repositories"

Once I did that, I looked through commits to find when the segfault was fixed.
The issue of "git merge-tree" causing a segfault in read-only repositories was fixed by the following commits:
