1) Downloaded tarball, move it to SeasNet sever, unzipped it (results in .git file),
run git clone .git randall
2) Added check function in make file which calles test.sh script
3) Seperate out program into options, output, hardware, and software.
Creating all necessary c and header files
4) Modify Makefile to compile all .c and .o files instead of just one
5) testing make. run into a few issues using static methods.
removed static keyword from said methods
6) Adding options. Adding a switch statement to randall.c that parses options,
storing input and output
options into variables and delivering error messages for invalid options
