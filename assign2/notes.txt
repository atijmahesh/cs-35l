1. C-h k C-h k opens up a description in the help buffer of the C-h k binding. This is because the original command triggers describe-key, which will describe the next command you type. 
2. C-h k M-SPC opens up a description in the help buffer of the M-SPC command. The M-SPC command deletes all whitespace (spaces and tabs) around the invoked point, leaving one space left. 
Homework 2)
1) When invoked on /dev/null, an error appears (IndexError: list index out of range) since there aren’t lines for the program to process. 
2) With Python 2, the script has no errors and outputs a random line from the file. In Python 3, there is an error since there is an invalid syntax. 
3) shuf.py works with both Python2 and Python3

Predating Python 3.11 (/usr/bin/python3):
Median User+Sys: 0.567s
Post Python 3.11 (/usr/local/cs/bin/python3):
Median User+Sys: 0.402s
Benchmark Coreutils shuf using /usr/local/cs/bin/shuf:
Median User+Sys: 0.075s
Upon conducting the benchmarks, we observed notable differences in the median user+sys times. For our custom Python implementation, the results demonstrated a remarkable enhancement post-Python 3.11. The median user+sys time decreased from 0.567s to 0.402s, indicating a substantial improvement in execution efficiency. Meanwhile, the system's pre-Python 3.11 version maintained a consistent median user+sys time of 0.567s, emphasizing the positive impact of the Python upgrade on our custom implementation's speed.


Additionally, when comparing Python-based solutions with Coreutils' shuf tool, it became evident that Coreutils exhibited superior performance. The shuf tool consistently outperformed both the pre and post-Python 3.11 versions, registering a median user+sys time of 0.075s. This benchmark underscored the efficiency of Coreutils' implementation for this specific task, offering a competitive advantage over Python-based solutions.


In summary, the benchmarks reaffirm the significance of Python 3.11's improvements, showcasing tangible speed enhancements in our custom implementation. However, Coreutils' shuf emerged as the most efficient tool for the given task.
